# FizzBuzz Application (.NET)

## Overview
This project is a C#/.NET implementation of the classic **FizzBuzz** problem, designed using **clean architecture principles** such as:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Injection
- Unit Testing

The application processes an array of input values and returns:
- `Fizz` if the value is divisible by 3
- `Buzz` if the value is divisible by 5
- `FizzBuzz` if the value is divisible by both 3 and 5
- Division messages if none of the above apply
- `Invalid Item` for empty or non-numeric inputs
